        </header>
        
        <p> The main goal of the project is to design the most efficient wind turbine. 
            Throughout the course of the project we have tested differences in the blades such as blade material, pitch (blade angle) and shape.
             When testing the generation of power, we tested different resistor strengths including 10, 30, 51, and 100 Ohm resistors.

            <p>Pictured to the left are the connections from the arduino to the power output board. The arduino was plugged into the laptop. From the arduino board there were two wires (one in the ground port and one in the “A0” port) that connected to a set of alligator clips. The alligator clips that were connected to the ground port were connected to the black alligator clips and connected to the power output board. The black cord from the generator was connected to another black alligator clip and connected to the resistor on the power output board. The other small wire that was connected to the “A0” port was connected to the red alligator clips. On was connected from the red generator cord to the resistor on the power output board. The other was connected from the “A0” port to the resistor on the power output board.
